# Type-Tester-web
This is my first website (with backend included)
This project is a website in which you play a typing game. Pretty much type as fast as you can and get your score, don't miss a letter or space!
This project helped me understand better server and database more. I learned a lot in user authentification. 
Also a good practice of front end using html, bootstrap, javascript and css
